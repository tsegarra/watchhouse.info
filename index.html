And even though it wasn’t when the album immediately came out, it wasn’t this huge blast. It just felt like the course of the whole year after that record came out it was really still like gaining new audiences for us. So, that has felt really strong going into this next record, because it feels like we were able to get in front of so many more people with this other one.</p>
<p>Andrew:I was going to say too, with This Side of Jordan, that was definitely, to me, some of the strongest tunes. Those are still our favorite ones to play, actually.</p>

I just want to check it out and see how close I can get.’ And then realizing all the sudden that you can’t turn back,” Marlin says. “The Doorman is just the guy standing at the gate saying, ‘Hey, I’ve got no friends over here.

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: That one, the place I grew up home to, called Jump Mountain, it’s just outside of Lexington, Virginia. There’s some old folklore surrounding the mountain. The legend goes — I’ll give you the Cliff’s Notes version — this young Native American girl was in love with this one guy, and her father wanted her to marry this other guy, this rich guy. So they had a race up the mountain to see who would catch her, and whoever caught her would win. So, instead of allowing herself to be caught, she ends up jumping off the mountain. So the whole moral behind it is, that her ghost rises up every night and makes that same run. So the song is basically her dad reflecting, watching his daughter’s ghost rise up.</p>

</div></div></li></ul></div><div class="song"><h3>Blue Ruin</h3>
<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: It’s just one of those heavy things. I think, just the timing in our lives, when it happened. And just the fact it happened in school when all these kids were brutally murdered. I think the point of the tune was just to shine a spotlight on that, but also violence in general. You can’t stop violence with violence.</p>
<p>Emily: It’s just one of those things too. Like, I think, with all of our music, and with anybody’s music, part of what compels — and I, again, don’t write the songs — but from being around it and thinking about it a lot, it’s not like Andrew woke up one day and was like, “I need to write a song about that.” It’s like those things that happen that are so — like you almost emotionally can’t process them because they’re so heavy. You can’t even think about it and make any kind of sense of it. That I feel like it’s almost inevitable that some kind of song or expression has to come out of that. Because you can’t, like, talk about it. You can’t figure it out. You can’t make it better. You just have to sort of like let it come out in a different way.</p>
<p>That song is basically… the night before that happened, our roommate at the time had had her 30th birthday party, so we threw down and woke up feeling terrible and I’m just lying in bed on Twitter, and that’s when I heard about it and I came out into the living room where they all were and we’re all just laid out feeling so sorry for ourselves because we poisoned ourselves the night before, and that’s kind of the first line of that song, it says, “one morning after drinking”.</p>
<p>Andrew: It’s not the sentiment of “no matter how shitty we feel right now, tomorrow we won’t be hung over anymore” but, like, “these kids still won’t be here”. The heaviest moment that we’ve ever faced doesn’t even come close to how heavy that realization must be for the parents and everyone involved. That song just kind of came out of that suffering and is what it is.</p>

And that was an idea that Kyle, our drummer, and Clint, the bass player, had, and we all loved it. We were just messing around with it in the studio and it ended up being a big turning point for us because then we realized that not only did we have musicians that were capable of taking sections like that and just running with it, but also that these guys just have some great ideas. We all tried to open ourselves up to everyone’s ideas and I think that’s what led it to sounding like it does. It was more a collaborative production.”</p>

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>“I think ‘Hard Travelin’’ was probably the biggest shock to me because it came out like straight out of a honkytonk. The first time we ever got the five guys together we did a demo session. I called Kyle, who played the drums, because we had a mutual friend. We had never played with him before and so he came in and just for fun at the end of the day we did ‘Hard Travelin’’ straight honkytonk. And Josh was just ripping it on electric guitar and Emily and I sang it live and sang it really hard. It was a demo session. We weren’t gonna use it. We were planning on doing that song a little more bluegrassy. So we messed around with a bluegrassy version a little bit but then at the end of the recording session we went back to the original demo and were like ‘that’s a take.’ I think that was probably the biggest surprise for me because it was the first time we had ever gone into the studio to just completely fool around and ended up coming out with a really great take. I’m glad it ended up on the record the way it did. I think it’s how it was supposed to be.”</p>

<p>Emily: "He had such a love for travel, and specifically driving. He was of such a different generation than us, and I don't think could entirely wrap his head around what we do for a living. But we could relate when we talked about travel and driving and highways. He loved that we went to so many places, and he saw that as such a form of education. So a lot of that part of his personality is wrapped up in that song, too."</p>

<p>Andrew: “I think Emily's selling herself short there, because I've definitely got a lilt, and some timing things that I go to and do and she's really good about following those. I would say a lot of that is due to Emily's ability to sing harmony."</p>
<p>Interviewer: Well what’s it feel like when you do hit it? When you nail it and you know you got it right?</p>
<p>Emily: It is such a good feeling. There’s this buzz you hear. It’s almost like there’s a third voice there. Which, in that “Suspended in Heaven” chorus, there is a third voice. Josh Oliver is singing with us. But when we’re singing just the two of us live or on any track and you hit just that perfect critical point, it’s almost like there’s an extra sound in there.</p>

<p>Andrew: We did it right outside of Roanoke, Virginia. It’s not quite in the mountains, but it was in the hills for sure, a very peaceful place on a lake. I like making records in places that aren’t studios. It feels a little more free, to just go sit in a living room and to turn that space into a very positive musical environment is way more appealing to me than a studio where you’re watching the clock and every time you hear it tick that signifies a certain amount of money. I think you feel that relaxed energy. There’s no trying to beat the clock on this record. It’s exploring all the directions we could go as a band.</p>

<p>Andrew: A number of incidents. It isn’t unique. Every time somebody puts themselves out there on social media you have the people who love to drum up negative energy. And I can’t wrap my head around it because that’s not how I was brought up. I rarely meet people who would do that when they’re talking to you face to face. So I don’t understand why those people feel compelled to sit at their computer or pick up their phone and try to rip others apart. It’s a weird way to live.</p>
<p>BGS: Emily says it’s one of the favorite tracks you’ve ever laid down together.</p>
<p>Andrew: Yeah, I love the sound of that tune. It’s a gentle drive to it, the way the groove is so set. It has this steady pulse that fits with the whole idea of the tune, this nagging thing in the back of my head: why do people feel compelled to be such assholes?</p>

But there’s never that moment to have an actual conversation with eye contact and body language, and that’s what I was calling out in that song. If you wouldn’t do it standing beside somebody or sitting across from them at a dinner table, then why would you feel so compelled to rip them apart online? It doesn’t make sense.</p>

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: I wrote that tune after Jeff Austin committed suicide. I didn’t know him super well, but we had a lot of mutual friends and had crossed paths through the years and it woke me up in a scary way. Being a full-time musician you have to continually find new ways to stay relevant and interesting to people, and you have to deal with real bouts of anxiety and self-consciousness. Is this good enough? Am I good enough? Writing and playing is something I’m extremely driven to do for myself, but I also have to do it for others, and I throw my music out in the world to be judged by other people. It’s a weird process that I’ve found is extremely helped by therapy!</p>
<p>BGS: So is that what performing is for you: “Hiding from the monsters in the belly of the beast”?</p>
<p>Andrew: Yes — I love that line. When people talk about being nervous to perform, for me it’s not wondering whether I’m able to perform well, it’s more that when I step out on stage I don’t know what that crowd’s energy is going to be, how receptive they’re going to be. Are these people going to allow me to be myself tonight or am I going to have to put on a hat? For the most part our fans are really receptive and I can be myself. That’s when it feels like things are right.</p>

</div></div></li><li><div class="excerpt"><p>EH: 'Hiding from the monsters in the belly of the beast' is one of my favorite lines from this record, maybe because I can’t figure out what it means. Can you help me out here?</p>
<p>Andrew: “That’s a pretty out-there line for me, because it kind of means a bunch of different things. You know, just the pattern of being a touring musician, and drawing so much inspiration from getting out and sharing songs with people night after night, you never really know how you're going to feel on a given night – or I never know how I'm going to feel on a given night when I step out on that stage. And yet, I still have to enter into the emotion of the song, and be there for those people that are there to take in these lyrics and these moments in this music.</p>
<p>So, I think that’s a big part of that line. I feel like I've almost become haunted by some of these things that I've talked about in these songs, you know, whether it be the loss of my mom, or just dealing with some of the darker parts of how I exist, and then having to kind of rehash that every night and re-share that every night sometimes can be a little overwhelming.”</p>

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>BN1: The video for New Star captivated us, as it offered a narrative and a range of welcoming emotions – which is increasingly rare in modern pop promos. How much input do you have on the scripting? And do you like your videos to tell a story?</p>
<p>Andrew: Amelia nailed that video. She brought forth the concept and we loved it. I remember finally seeing it for the first time and getting bleary eyed. There are so many close friends and community members of ours featured in the video and, especially after over a year without seeing so many of them, it felt like a homecoming.</p>

</div></div></li></ul></div><div class="song"><h3>Upside Down</h3>
<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: Yeah, I just like how the song keeps morphing. It was kind of talking about meeting our daughter for the first time. And then, it’s that real vision that I’m sure every parent has, where you’re like, oh my gosh, I’ve been missing you my entire life but I didn’t know that was you I was missing until I got you in my arms right now. And then just like how fast life changes from that point on.</p>
<p>I think the song captures that really beautifully. It never stops moving. And some of the parts are really intense, and some are really peaceful. Which I think goes hand in hand with being a new parent. So I don’t think that was the intention of the tune, but I do love that that can be derived from it now.</p>

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>In the song “Lonely Love Affair,” Marlin sings about having a “stranger” in his house, which he says refers to himself, not his daughter. When he saw his daughter for the first time, he got a strange feeling of forgetting how to exist as himself and write songs.</p>

</div></div></li><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Holler: The song ‘Lonely Love Affair’ is such an interesting take on parenthood, with the daughter being a kind of stranger in the house. Where did that song spring from?</p>
<p>Andrew: It’s actually the opposite.</p>
<p>Holler: You guys are the strangers?</p>
<p>Andrew: We are. I can’t speak for Emily, but I can speak for myself. I felt like a stranger to myself after Ruby was born, because suddenly I had this whole new purpose in life and a whole new intention. It was almost like getting to know myself all over again. These moments where I was spending time with myself, suddenly it was hard to find a zone to write and to want to play what I was writing about because I wasn’t stepping away from my day-to-day; I was stepping away from this little being that required me to be there all the time, to keep it alive.</p>
<p>That was in the first week, I think, when I wrote ‘Lonely Love Affair’. There’s also a spiritual essence about that tune, where babies are the link between the real world and the spiritual world.</p>

<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Holler: ‘Coming Down from Green Mountain’ is such a beautiful instrumental. How did it come together in the studio?</p>
<p>Andrew: I wrote that one at the end of a musical festival.</p>
<p>Holler: Which one?</p>
<p>Andrew: Green Mountain Bluegrass & Roots. It’s in Vermont.</p>
<p>Emily: It’s a small, relatively new festival that started a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Andrew: It was a weekend full of playing with some of my favorite people to play with. When it came to an end, it had me feeling all these feelings - so I sat down at, like, 4 in the morning and wrote that tune. More and more, as I get older and dive deeper into the mandolin, I keep becoming more inspired by instrumental music.</p>
<p>I love how, especially on the recorded version, it sounds like we’re all searching. We ended up using the first take that we did. Josh Kaufman played the electric guitar on it, with Josh Oliver on acoustic, Clint on bass, Joe on drums, Emily on fiddle and me on mandolin. We all sat down and talked about where we wanted to go with it, but we kind of felt it out. I think we did two other takes after that first one, but that first one felt right. You can kind of hear Joe trying to figure out where his drumbeats are going to be. It’s evolving the whole time. I love that searching feel.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we ended up using that take is because, since we recorded it at this lake house, we had this beautiful view of the lake. During the first take, Josh Oliver starts getting this huge grin on his face. There were these two guys on a boat out on the lake and they caught this huge fish right in the middle of the take. We never stopped playing but we all looked out there, and we’re all smiling and silently cheering these guys on because they were so stoked to catch this big fish. We thought we have to keep this take now, because if not it’s the one that got away.</p>

</div></div></li></ul></div><div class="song"><h3>Beautiful Flowers</h3>
<ul><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: I hit a butterfly when I was driving down the road and it really bummed me out. Animals have no ideas what cars are. For something to come out of nowhere at 70 miles per hour has got to be the weirdest thing in the world. And that got me thinking about who had made the first car, and it turned out it was this guy, Karl Benz. And when he made this car he had no idea where it was going to lead and how terrible it was going to be for the environment.</p>
<p>For our own convenience we destroy a lot of this world and don’t give a lot back as humans. And my car hitting that butterfly felt like a really strong metaphor for what we’re doing to the earth. It’s a very delicate ecosystem and we’re killing all its intricate little working parts.</p>

<p class="date">8/27/2021</p>
</div></div></li><li><div class="excerpt"><p>Andrew: Yeah, I was just riding down the road and I saw this butterfly coming – or I guess I was going towards it – but whatever the case is, we were coming together (laughs). I couldn’t miss it, and it was this huge, beautiful butterfly, and just (slaps hands together) right into the windshield. I was like, ‘Ah, goddammit.’ That was a beautiful creature that I just destroyed in my search for convenience, you now, just to be able to drive down the road. Obviously, late at night I’d sit down to write that song with the total intention of paying homage to this butterfly and it ends up talking about the fuel industry and how, you know, cars are contributing to destroying our planet and all that good stuff.</p>
<p>But I feel like that’s one of the greatest things about songwriting too, is that it doesn’t have to be that specific. I think the music itself adds a lot of depth to what you’re saying, without having to say too much. I think that song is a good case point for that, where you just start off with an idea and the song itself will kind of almost tell you the way it wants to go, if you’re listening for it, which I try to do.</p>
